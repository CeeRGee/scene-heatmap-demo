# 🌡️📍 SCENE Heatmap Demo: Mapping Crime and Climate Impacts

This demo is part of the **SCENE** (Safety, Community, Empowerment, Never Exploited) platform — a tool for visualizing how **crime data and weather vulnerabilities** intersect in communities that are often over-policed and under-resourced.

### 🔥 What This Demo Shows

This repo includes a Python script that:

- Loads **neighborhood-level data** (crime reports, temperature, coordinates)
- Aggregates values using `pandas` and `.agg()` for quick insight
- Generates an **interactive heatmap** using `folium` and `HeatMap`
- Outputs an HTML file that can be opened or hosted anywhere

---

### ⚙️ Technologies Used

- `pandas` for data aggregation and prep  
- `folium` and `folium.plugins.HeatMap` for interactive maps  
- `matplotlib` (optional) for statistical visualizations  
- `Jupyter` or `VS Code
